# Circuitry
*Microservices Web App created using .NET 8.0*

This project was created for learning purposes in order to experiment with a new concept for me: Multi-architectural microservices - each service will be developed using a different architecture, depending on the use case (Vertical Slice Architecture, DDD, N-Layered, etc.)

Technologies Used List (*will be updated accordingly*):
- .NET 8.0
- MassTransit
- RabbitMQ
- MediatR
- FluentAssertions
- Marten
- PostgreSQL

*(Work is currently in progress)*

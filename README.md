# Circuitry
*Microservices Web App created using .NET 8.0*
---
- This project was created for learning purposes in order to experiment with a new concept for me: **Multi-architectural microservices** 
- Each service will be developed using a different architecture, depending on the use case (Vertical Slice Architecture, DDD, N-Layered, etc.)

## Update - 24/01/2025 ✅
- Developed Catalog.API microservice ✅
- Developed Basket.API microservice ✅
- Added distributed caching using Redis for Basket.API ✅
- Implemented synchronous communication between Basket and Catalog and Discounts APIs using gRPC client/servers *(in progress)*

## Technologies Used List (*will be updated accordingly*):
- .NET 8.0
- MassTransit
- RabbitMQ
- gRPC
- MediatR
- FluentAssertions
